[25.01.25, 02:43:15] Romeo: 😘
[25.01.25, 10:51:16] Romeo: Hey, sweetie, have you showered yet?
[25.01.25, 11:00:44] Julia: Yes, and much longer than usual.
[25.01.25, 11:01:22] Romeo: I prefer baths.
[25.01.25, 11:01:38] Romeo: Especially after exercise.
[25.01.25, 11:05:25] Julia: 😉
[25.01.25, 11:11:47] Romeo: Here there are also showers... have you showered there yet?
[25.01.25, 11:12:51] Julia: Excuse me? Ugh!
Jimmy every day... but nothing disgusts him!
[25.01.25, 11:13:14] Romeo: Frank too
[25.01.25, 11:16:06] Julia: You didn't want to go there... with me...?!??!
[25.01.25, 11:17:46] Romeo: No!
[25.01.25, 11:18:43] Romeo: That's not erotic... 🤢

[25.01.25, 11:27:51] Juliet: 😂
[25.01.25, 11:33:38] Juliet: Are you aware of what happened yesterday?
[25.01.25, 11:34:04] Romeo: Does it have to be?
[25.01.25, 11:39:02] Julia: I don't know.
[25.01.25, 11:41:01] Romeo: What happened...? I actually prefer to discuss things like that over dinner.
[25.01.25, 11:43:51] Julia: Not much. But not nothing either.
[25.01.25, 11:43:59] Julia: Let's do it! 😘
[25.01.25, 11:45:43] Romeo: Wednesday?
[25.01.25, 11:46:29] Julia: I can't tell you until Monday.
[25.01.25, 11:47:12] Romeo: Okay, have a nice weekend. Love you. 🥰
[25.01.25, 11:47:47] Julia: 😘
[26.01.25, 09:05:26] Romeo: Hi Anja, did you sleep well?
[26.01.25, 10:43:43] Julia: Almost...
[26.01.25, 10:46:50] Romeo: Are you coming tomorrow?
[26.01.25, 10:48:43] Julia: No... not until Tuesday.
Why?
[26.01.25, 10:49:25] Romeo: Because I miss you 😢
[26.01.25, 10:51:42] Julia: Then you're looking forward to Tuesday! 😘
[26.01.25, 10:52:07] Romeo: I am 😊
[26.01.25, 11:52:43] Romeo: I'm glad 😘
[26.01.25, 11:54:55] Juliet: You're thinking of me.
[26.01.25, 11:57:05] Romeo: Of course!
[26.01.25, 14:48:56] Romeo: Still 🥰/Users/maniafscharyazdi/Downloads/Chat de WhatsApp con 💬.zip
[26.01.25, 14:52:12] Juliet: Good.
[01/26/25, 3:14:02 PM] Romeo: I think so too 😊
[01/27/25, 8:03:37 AM] Romeo: Good morning 😘
[01/27/25, 8:28:53 AM] Julia: Good morning 😘
[01/27/25, 8:30:00 AM] Romeo: I'm 100% ready for vacation again
[01/27/25, 8:30:26 AM] Romeo: 30 minutes of Conti is enough 🤦‍♂️
[01/27/25, 8:36:46 AM] Julia: Take a vacation! 🧳☀️
[27.01.25, 08:37:39] Romeo: And leave you alone with Theileis?
[27.01.25, 08:38:41] Julia: Don't worry! He really likes me.
[27.01.25, 08:38:50] Julia: And he'll look after me.
[27.01.25, 08:39:24] Romeo: He's writing absolute nonsense.
[27.01.25, 08:39:44] Julia: Possibly...
[27.01.25, 08:40:05] Julia: I'm talking to Thomas on the phone right now. 🤗
[27.01.25, 08:48:39] Romeo: I chatted with him too
[27.01.25, 08:49:06] Romeo: And asked why you chat so often 🤣
[27.01.25, 08:50:34] Romeo: I'm just eating out of frustration
[27.01.25, 08:54:25] Julia: That's this special attraction between us...
[27.01.25, 08:59:16] Romeo: You filthy bastard
[27.01.25, 09:11:08] Romeo: But I understand, Allgäu people are sexy
[27.01.25, 09:12:27] Julia: If you say so!
[01/27/25, 9:12:38 AM] Julia: When are you talking to me?
[01/27/25, 9:13:35 AM] Romeo: I still have to do something for Michi, he needs it by 9:30, after that?
[01/27/25, 9:13:49 AM] Julia: Absolutely!
[01/27/25, 9:13:55 AM] Julia: Thanks!
[01/27/25, 10:16:26 AM] Romeo: Okay, I'm a bit more relaxed 😘
[01/27/25, 10:22:56 AM] Julia: I'm glad Ingo can make that happen... 😉
[01/27/25, 10:24:19 AM] Romeo: I have to disappoint you, it was probably primarily due to our phone call.
[27.01.25, 10:24:59] Romeo: And the joy of tackling the technical logging together 🤣
[27.01.25, 10:26:44] Julia: You're a good actor!

Anyone else would have apologized to you beforehand for even calling you...
[27.01.25, 10:28:05] Romeo: Sorry, Monday morning... I'll make it up to you, I promise.
[27.01.25, 10:29:33] Julia: Everything's fine! 😘
[27.01.25, 10:31:11] Romeo: ♥️
[27.01.25, 10:33:54] Romeo: Drenda is watching the ticket, so don't write greetings like "Honey" or "Mousey" on it!
[27.01.25, 10:38:46] Julia: I don't like "Schnucki" or "Mausi", sweetie!
[27.01.25, 10:39:06] Romeo: Then that's fine.
[27.01.25, 10:54:54] Romeo: I wonder how many people would be interested if you wrote that down and how many would then sign up as observers. 🤣
[27.01.25, 10:55:19] Romeo: That would be worth a try. 👍
[27.01.25, 11:12:15] Julia: Should I?
[27.01.25, 11:13:46] Romeo: I wouldn't recommend it, but I would be interested in the outcome... what a dilemma 🤔
[27.01.25, 11:17:29] Julia: Why are you interested?
[27.01.25, 11:22:13] Romeo: Because you're an extremely attractive woman, and many probably wish they could desire you. It's no coincidence that Roland stammers nervously when he tries to compliment you.
[27.01.25, 11:31:15] Julia: Oh dear... what girl wouldn't be able to do that?
If you don't come across as ugly and uncharming, then... pretty much anyone can get anyone!
Even the stupid blackbird would be in the mix! Maybe not
